<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In 2008 I graduated from the Sumy Professional College, National University of Food Technologies, profession: "Maintenance of computer systems and networks".</p>

<p>Then I decided to enter Sumy State University, profession: "Translation and teaching English and German", since graduating from the University I've been working as an English teacher.</p>

<p>But I always felt like lacking something. Now I now that it's my 
  technical half to which I'm currently trying to give a chance to show itself learning how to program and trying to solve some technical tasks.</p>
